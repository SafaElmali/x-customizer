# Privacy Policy

**X.com Customizer**

*Last updated: January 18, 2026*

## Data Collection

X.com Customizer does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data.

## What We Store

The extension only stores your UI preferences (toggle settings) using Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.sync` API. This allows your choices to persist between browser sessions and sync across your devices when signed into Chrome.

## How It Works

All UI customization is performed **locally** on X.com and Twitter.com pages in your browser. The extension simply adds CSS classes to hide elements you've toggled off.

## Third Parties

- No analytics or tracking
- No advertising
- No third-party scripts
- No external network requests
- No data sharing of any kind

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| `storage` | Save your toggle preferences locally |
| `activeTab` | Apply your settings to the current X.com tab |
| `host_permissions` for x.com/twitter.com | Required to inject the CSS that hides elements |
